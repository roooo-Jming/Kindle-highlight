“For a moment there, during the talk . . . I really enjoyed myself. I was panicky. Close to puking, for sure. But while I was talking to this huge group of people about my work and my hypotheses and my ideas, and explaining my reasoning and the trials and errors and why what I research is so important, I . . . I felt confident. I felt good at it. It all felt right and fun. Like science is supposed to be when you share it.” She wrapped her arms around herself. “Like maybe I could be an academic, down the road. A real one. And maybe make a difference.”

A truth that, I think, will be best for you. A truth that will take me out of the equation, but will make its result better. Because I’m starting to wonder if this is what being in love is. Being okay with ripping yourself to shreds, so the other person can stay whole.

A lie, after a lot of lies. So many lies she’d told, so many true things she could have said but never did, all because she’d been too scared of the truth, of driving the people she loved away from her. All because she’d been afraid to lose them. All because she hadn’t wanted to be alone again.

We were best friends in our late twenties, and we both had great six-figure jobs, nice cars, big houses, plenty of toys, and an abundance of stuff. And yet with all this stuff, we knew we were not satisfied with our lives. We knew we were not happy or fulfilled. We discovered that working 70–80 hours a week and buying more stuff didn’t fill the void. So we took back control of our lives using the principles of minimalism to focus on what’s important.

With each promotion at work, with each award or fancy trip we won, with every nugget of praise we received, the happiness accompanying those things quickly came and went. The faster it came, the faster it was gone. So we sought happiness by attempting to get more of these nuggets of praise, trying to improve our feelings of self-worth and significance by “achieving” more. We worked harder and harder to obtain these nuggets, often working twice as many hours as the average American to prove our value.

Because we grew up relatively poor, we thought that the key to our happiness would be money. Specifically: If we could just make $50,000 per year, then we’d be set. Our parents hadn’t earned that kind of money, and they weren’t happy, so we figured if we could pass some kind of arbitrary threshold ($50,000 per annum, in this case), then we would somehow be happy.

A change in dietary lifestyle is not only a change in what you consume but a change in how you think about what you consume. A temporary diet almost always fails after the post-diet behavior commences. A lifestyle change, by definition, can’t fail unless you make a negative change thereafter.

When you change yourself—when you lead by example—often times the people closest to you will follow suit. If you change your diet, start exercising, start paying close attention to your important relationships, and set higher relationship standards, then you’ll notice other people doing the same thing. If the best version of you shows up to the party, you’ll be able to bring the best out of other people. Unfortunately, there will be times when certain relationships don’t work—be it marriages, intimate relationships, close friendships, employee-boss relationships, relationships with family members, etc. The best thing you can do is change yourself (not attempt to change the other person). You don’t have to stay in a relationship if you are unhappy. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t make an effort to get to the root of the relationship’s problems—it means that you can change the relationship if it is not working.  Before you change or terminate a relationship, you should get a vision of what you’d like it to look like in the future. The following sections discuss specific ideas on how to envision a new future for your relationships. Relationship Growth Suffice it to say, no matter how positive or negative your current relationships are, you want them to improve so you have outstanding future relationships. Even the greatest relationships need to grow to remain great. In fact, the best relationships are always growing—that’s one of the reasons they’re so great. If your relationships aren’t growing, they’re dying. But when your relationships grow, you feel alive.  Seeking & Selecting Future Relationships Without a vision, people perish. We’ve all heard that before. The same is true for our relationships, especially our primary relationships. Without a vision, you will settle for whatever is in front of you. Thus, you need a compelling vision of what you want your relationships to be, what you want your relationships to look like. If your vision is compelling enough, you’ll do anything to make it happen. There are three things to consider when seeking new relationships (or improving your current relationships):

“Honesty is a gift we can give others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity,” Dr. Sam Harris wrote in his book, LYING. He continued by stating, “Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. We can simply be ourselves.”

It’s a cultural imperative, the American Dream, it’s what we’re taught to do. We’re taught to work incredibly hard in high school or college, doing stuff we don’t care much about, then find a good job, one with reliable pay, good benefits, and maybe a retirement plan.

People who are passionate about what they do are in most ways just like people who aren’t passionate about their work. Some days passionate people don’t want to get out of bed, sometimes they don’t feel like starting work on the new project that’s looming in front of them. Other days they jump out of bed feeling excited and motivated by their mission.

The Kennedys were dead. Martin Luther King Jr. had been killed standing on a balcony in Memphis, setting off riots across the country, including in Chicago. The 1968 Democratic National Convention turned bloody as police went after Vietnam War protesters with batons and tear gas in Grant Park, about nine miles north of where we lived. White families, meanwhile, were moving out of the city in droves, lured by the suburbs—the promise of better schools, more space, and probably more whiteness, too.
