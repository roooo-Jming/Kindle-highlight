“For a moment there, during the talk . . . I really enjoyed myself. I was panicky. Close to puking, for sure. But while I was talking to this huge group of people about my work and my hypotheses and my ideas, and explaining my reasoning and the trials and errors and why what I research is so important, I . . . I felt confident. I felt good at it. It all felt right and fun. Like science is supposed to be when you share it.” She wrapped her arms around herself. “Like maybe I could be an academic, down the road. A real one. And maybe make a difference.”

A truth that, I think, will be best for you. A truth that will take me out of the equation, but will make its result better. Because I’m starting to wonder if this is what being in love is. Being okay with ripping yourself to shreds, so the other person can stay whole.

A lie, after a lot of lies. So many lies she’d told, so many true things she could have said but never did, all because she’d been too scared of the truth, of driving the people she loved away from her. All because she’d been afraid to lose them. All because she hadn’t wanted to be alone again.

We were best friends in our late twenties, and we both had great six-figure jobs, nice cars, big houses, plenty of toys, and an abundance of stuff. And yet with all this stuff, we knew we were not satisfied with our lives. We knew we were not happy or fulfilled. We discovered that working 70–80 hours a week and buying more stuff didn’t fill the void. So we took back control of our lives using the principles of minimalism to focus on what’s important.

With each promotion at work, with each award or fancy trip we won, with every nugget of praise we received, the happiness accompanying those things quickly came and went. The faster it came, the faster it was gone. So we sought happiness by attempting to get more of these nuggets of praise, trying to improve our feelings of self-worth and significance by “achieving” more. We worked harder and harder to obtain these nuggets, often working twice as many hours as the average American to prove our value.

Because we grew up relatively poor, we thought that the key to our happiness would be money. Specifically: If we could just make $50,000 per year, then we’d be set. Our parents hadn’t earned that kind of money, and they weren’t happy, so we figured if we could pass some kind of arbitrary threshold ($50,000 per annum, in this case), then we would somehow be happy.

A change in dietary lifestyle is not only a change in what you consume but a change in how you think about what you consume. A temporary diet almost always fails after the post-diet behavior commences. A lifestyle change, by definition, can’t fail unless you make a negative change thereafter.
